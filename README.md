# Simone Levy - Data Analysis Portfolio
## About

Hello, I'm Simone, a soon-to-be graduate of The George Washington University with a degree in Computer Science and Information Systems. While I've honed my skills in software engineering, 
my passion for data analytics has driven me to uncover hidden insights within data and enhance business solutions.
Feel free to look through my portfolio as a showcase of my skills and continued progress in my data analytics journey.

## Projects
## 1. A prediction model for the number of crew members on a cruise ship.

**Project:**  [(crew nember prediction model)](https://github.com/simolevy/DataAnalysisPortfolio/tree/22ac45f104315b8a7fedb6416e716abc523ff32c/Notebooks/CruiseCountPrediction)


**Description:** This project uses online data about various cruise liners to predict the number of crew members that should
be included on a cruise ship. The project involves lightly processing and cleaning the data, training the data, creating a method
to showcase the accuracy of the model, and a cross validation phase to test the model.


## 2. Advertisement Relevance Classification Prediction Model

**Project:** [(ad relevance prediction model)](https://github.com/simolevy/DataAnalysisPortfolio/tree/2d0f68a1936616621324b669916cdb26a8ef25a4/Notebooks/LogisticRegression)


**Description:** This project uses data about various advertisements for farm medications to predict the probability that certain ads will be useful.
